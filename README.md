Project 0x02 teaches the concepts of functions and nested loops. The function prototype for each file is in the holberton.h header file. Also, the main.c files were used to test each program and ensure the correct output. Each file in this project is as follows:

#0, called _putchar is writing a program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line. This program shoud return 0.

#1 is writing a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. And _putchar can only be used twice in the code

#2 is write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Also, _putchar can only be used twice in the code.

#3 is write a function that checks for lowercase character. It returns 1 if the letter is lowercase and return 0 otherwise.

#4 is write a function that checks for alphabetic character.

#5 is a program that prints the sign of a number

#6 is a program that computes the absolute value of an integer.

#7 is a program that prints the last digit of a number.

#8 is a program that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

#9 is a program that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

#10 is a program that adds two integers and returns the result.

#11 is a program that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
